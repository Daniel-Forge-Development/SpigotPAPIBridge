A bridge from Spigot PAPI to Forge PAPI

# Installation Instructions
Before you begin, this will only work on Magma/Mohist/Other Spigot Hybrid. 
**THIS WILL NOT WORK ON SPONGE!**

You will need to have [PlaceholderAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/) and [ForgePlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/EnvyWare/ForgePlaceholderAPI) Installed to make use of this.

Once you have PlaceholderAPI from Spigot Installed, download the latest release and Install It to `/plugins/PlaceholderAPI/expansions/` and reboot.

# Configuration Instructions
The purpose of this Is to use Forge Placeholders from ForgePlaceholderAPI In Spigot plugins such as DeluxeMenus.

The placeholder Is `%FPAPIBridge_<forge_placeholder>%` where `forge_placeholder` Is replaced with whatever placeholder from ForgePlaceholderAPI **without the % symbols**. Available placeholders can be found [here](https://github.com/EnvyWare/ForgePlaceholderAPI-Extensions/wiki).
